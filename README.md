# VRConfirmTour
This project was the second VR experience I built. I was hired by Confirm Smart Manufacturing based on my previous project (VR Moral Machine), and was tasked with just recreating the factory line in the building.

I created a digital twin of the manufacturing line in Confirm, but since I did this fairly easily, I then decided to built the rest of the building around it..

This VR experience is being used as a training tool to onboard employees by allowing them to virtually explore the campus before they come on-site.
